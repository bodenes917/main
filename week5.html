                    </div>
                    <p>Welcome to Week 5, the final week of your AI Starter Sprint. You've practised the learning mode. You've practised refining your prompts. You've practised learning out loud. You've deepened one of those practices through your next-level experiment. Now it's time to embed what you've learned into how you actually work.</p>

                    <p>This week is about stepping back and looking at your work as a whole. Where does AI fit? Where can it save you time? Where should you stay in the driver's seat?</p>

                    <p>Up until now, you've been experimenting with AI as a tool you use occasionally. This week, you're going to practice thinking of AI as part of how you work, embedded in your routine, not bolted on as an afterthought.</p>

                    <p>This requires a different kind of thinking. You're not asking "What can AI do for me?" You're asking "Where in my workflow could AI take the routine work off my plate so I can focus on what matters?" Where could AI make you faster, sharper, or more creative without replacing your judgment?</p>

                    <p>You're stepping back from the day-to-day tasks and looking at the workflow as a whole. You're identifying the bottlenecks, the friction points, the places where you're spending energy on work that doesn't need your full attention. And then you're redesigning the system with AI embedded at one leverage point.</p>

                    <div class="callout callout-goal">
                        <strong>Your goal this week:</strong> Map a small, repeatable workflow, identify one place where AI could create leverage, redesign the workflow with AI embedded, and test it. Notice what changes.

                    <p>You'll map the current workflow, identify where AI could create leverage, redesign it with AI embedded, and test the new version.</p>

                                <h4>Step 1: Pick a Small, Repeatable Workflow (5 Minutes)</h4>
                                <p>Choose one workflow you repeat at least once a week that takes 30-60 minutes. Don't pick something huge.</p>
                                <p><strong>Good examples:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>How I prepare for 1:1 meetings</li>
                                    <li>How I draft weekly status updates</li>

                                    <li>How I prioritize my tasks for the week</li>
                                    <li>How I review and respond to feedback</li>
                                    <li>Using AI to draft a shift handover report</li>
                                    <li>Getting AI to help plan a weekly roster</li>
                                    <li>Using AI to summarise inspection notes</li>

                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>Bad examples (too big):</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>How I manage my entire week</li>
                                    <li>How I run projects</li>

                                </ul>
                                <div class="callout callout-info">
                                    <strong>Test:</strong> Can you describe the workflow in 5-7 steps? If yes, it's the right size. If no, it's too big.

                                <p><strong>Don't ask:</strong> "What could AI do instead of me?"</p>
                                <p><strong>Ask:</strong> "Where could AI make me faster, sharper, or more creative?"</p>
                                <p>Look for these opportunities:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Repetitive cognitive work:</strong> Is there a step you do the same way every time?</li>
                                    <li><strong>Synthesis or summarization:</strong> Is there a step where you're pulling together information?</li>
                                    <li><strong>Ideation or brainstorming:</strong> Is there a step where you're generating options?</li>
                                    <li><strong>Pattern recognition:</strong> Is there a step where you're looking for trends?</li>

                                <p><strong>Pick ONE step where AI could fit.</strong> Don't try to embed AI everywhere. Just one leverage point.</p>

                                <h4>Step 4: Redesign the Workflow with AI Embedded (10 Minutes)</h4>
                                <p>Rewrite your workflow with AI as a component in one step.</p>

                                <p>Choose one team workflow that:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Happens regularly (weekly or monthly)</li>
                                    <li>Involves multiple people</li>
                                    <li>Takes 30-90 minutes</li>
                                    <li>Feels like it could be better</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>Good examples:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>How we run retrospectives</li>
                                    <li>How we collect and synthesize feedback</li>
                                    <li>How we generate ideas for [thing]</li>
                                    <li>How we prepare for key meetings</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>Bad examples (too big or too vague):</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>How we communicate (too broad)</li>
                                    <li>How we run projects (too big)</li>
                                    <li>How we work together (too abstract)</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h4>Step 2: Map the Current Workflow WITH Your Team (30-45 Minutes)</h4>
                                <p>You'll need to facilitate this. Use this structure:</p>
                                <p><strong>Agenda:</strong></p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Frame the session (5 min):</strong> "We're going to map how we currently do [workflow], identify where it's breaking down, and explore where AI might help."</li>
                                    <li><strong>Map the current workflow (15 min):</strong> As a group, identify Input, Steps, Output, and Pain Points</li>
                                    <li><strong>Identify one leverage point (10 min):</strong> "If we could make ONE step 10x faster, which would have the most impact?"</li>
                                    <li><strong>Brainstorm where AI could fit (10 min):</strong> "What could AI do at that step?"</li>
                                    <li><strong>Redesign together (10 min):</strong> Rewrite the workflow with AI embedded</li>
                                </ol>

                                <h4>Step 3: Test the Redesigned Workflow</h4>
                                <p>Actually try the new version once. Debrief as a team:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>What worked?</li>
                                    <li>What didn't?</li>
                                    <li>What would we change?</li>
                                </ul>
                                <div class="callout callout-info">
                                    This is a prototype, not a policy. You're testing, not committing.

                            <p><strong>1. Frame the Session (5 minutes)</strong></p>
                            <p>Say this: "We're going to spend the next 45 minutes mapping how we currently do [workflow]. The goal isn't to criticize how we work. It's to get clear on the process, identify where it's breaking down, and explore where AI might create leverage."</p>
                            <p>Set one ground rule: "There are no bad ideas in this session. We're exploring, not committing."</p>

                            <p><strong>2. Map the Current Workflow (15 minutes)</strong></p>
                            <p>Ask the team: "What triggers this workflow? What happens next? Walk me through the steps." Write them on the whiteboard. Listen for where people say "This takes forever."</p>

                            <p><strong>3. Identify One Leverage Point (10 minutes)</strong></p>
                            <p>Ask: "If we could make ONE step in this process 10x faster or easier, which step would have the biggest impact?" Let people vote or discuss.</p>

                            <p><strong>4. Brainstorm Where AI Could Fit (10 minutes)</strong></p>
                            <p>Ask: "At this step, what could AI do that would help us? Not replace us. Help us."</p>

                            <p><strong>5. Redesign Together (10 minutes)</strong></p>
                            <p>Rewrite the steps on the whiteboard with AI embedded at the leverage point.</p>

                            <p><strong>6. Close and Commit (5 minutes)</strong></p>
                            <p>Say: "This is a prototype, not a policy. Let's try this new version once and see what happens."</p>
