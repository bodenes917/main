                    </div>
                    <p>Welcome to Week 3. You've practised the learner's posture. You've practised refining your prompts. Now it's time to practise something harder: learning out loud.</p>

                    <p>Most of us learn in private. We experiment behind closed doors. We struggle in silence. We only share our work once it's polished, once we've figured it out, once we can present it with confidence. We've been trained to hide the mess&#x2014;to only show the after, never the during.</p>

                    <p>That privacy costs you. Connection. Feedback. Accelerated learning. When you learn in private, you miss the insights that come from other people's perspectives. You miss the moment where someone says "Oh, I tried that too&#x2014;here's what I learned." You miss the opportunity to model curiosity for the people around you.</p>

                    <p>Learning out loud doesn't mean oversharing or performing vulnerability. It means making your learning process visible to at least one other person. It means saying "I'm figuring this out" instead of waiting until you've figured it out. It means sharing a messy moment, a genuine question, or a point of confusion&#x2014;without cleaning it up first.</p>

                    <p>This is uncomfortable. It should be. You're making yourself visible while uncertain. But that discomfort is where making it safe to speak up begins&#x2014;not by waiting for someone else to create it, but by practicing it yourself.</p>

                    <div class="callout callout-goal">
                        <strong>Your goal this week:</strong> Share one messy moment from your AI experiments (or any recent work) with one person. Don't clean it up. Don't apologize for it. Just share it and notice what happens.

                    <p>This week, you're going to share something messy. Not a polished insight. Not a success story. A moment where you got stuck, tried something that didn't work, or felt genuinely confused.</p>

                    <p>The goal isn't to get advice or solutions. The goal is to practice making your learning process visible to another human being.</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>You got stuck</li>

                                    <li>You asked a bad question and got a weird answer</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Write it down in 2-3 sentences. Don't clean it up yet. Example:</p>
                                <div class="template-box">
                                    <p class="template-label">Example</p>

                                <p>Send it in a message, bring it up in a conversation, or raise it in a meeting. Use one of these frames:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>"I'm trying to figure this out. Here's where I got stuck: [your messy moment]. Have you run into this?"</li>

                                    <li>Telling your supervisor about a prompt that worked well</li>
                                    <li>Mentioning a mistake you made and what you learned from it</li>

                                        That's also data. It might mean people didn't see it, don't know how to respond, or the environment isn't set up for visible learning yet. You still practiced. That's the muscle.

                                        Talk to Eko about it. That discomfort is real and worth processing. Ask yourself: "What was I afraid would happen? Did it happen?" Sometimes the anticipation is worse than the experience.

                                        This is the best-case scenario. You just made it safe to speak up. Notice what that feels like. This is how cultures shift&#x2014;one visible learning moment at a time.
